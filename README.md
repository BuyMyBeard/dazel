# Dazel the Dazelle
Submission for the [Indie Game Dev Beginners #002](https://itch.io/jam/indie-game-dev-beginners-002) game jam.

Unfortunately we ran out of time. but I do want to finish this project. Probably in the following weeks.
The game can be played [here](https://buymybeard.itch.io/dazel-the-gazelle).


## Implementation Challenges
This was our first time working with Typescript and a bundler, and the experience was great,
~~Except for the fact our boilerplate was broken and had dependencies conflicts that created nightmare bugs~~
We had to migrate the project from [pixi-hotwire](https://github.com/miltoncandelero/pixi-hotwire) second to last version to the latest, which happened to get updated in middle of the jam.

I designed an Input Reader and a Collision Detector specifically for this game, which was an interesting challenge. It is not very efficient, but it is pretty easily extensible.

All things considered this was a wonderful project to partake in.
